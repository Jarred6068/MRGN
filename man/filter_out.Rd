\title{This function is wrapped by get.conf() when filter_int_child = TRUE. It identifies the confounders from sig.asso.pcs that are
correlated witht he genetic variant and removes them from the final list of confounders.}
\usage{
filter_out(sig.asso.pcs, trios, PCscores, filter.fdr)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig.asso.pcs}{a matrix of correlations between the genetic variants the covariate pool of potential confounders}

\item{trios}{see get.conf() for details}

\item{PCscores}{see get.conf() for details}

\item{filter.fdr}{the filtering fdr threshold}
}
\value{
a list of the significant associated PCs/confounders with the indices of the identified common child and intermediate
confounding variables removed.
